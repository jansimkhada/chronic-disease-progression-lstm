# chronic-disease-progression-lstm
Predicting chronic disease progression using LSTM on time-series medical data.

Step 1: Project Setup
Create a GitHub Repository
Repository name: chronic-disease-progression-lstm.
Add a README with a brief project overview.
Setup the Local Environment
Install Python and libraries: tensorflow, pandas, numpy, apache-spark, matplotlib, etc.
Use Docker to containerize the environment for portability (optional).
Plan the Project Workflow
Data collection and preprocessing.
Model building using LSTM.
Deployment on AWS SageMaker.
Create retraining pipelines.

Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing
Obtain a dataset
Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize features).
Tools: Pandas, Spark.
Define Data Pipeline
Use Apache Spark for distributed feature extraction and preprocessing.

Step 3: Model Development
Build the LSTM Model
Use TensorFlow/Keras to create and train the LSTM network.
Train on the preprocessed time-series dataset.
Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

Step 4: Deployment on AWS
Setup SageMaker
Train the model on SageMaker.
Configure retraining pipelines using AWS Lambda and S3 for data storage.
Integration
Deploy the trained model as a REST API or endpoint for real-time predictions.

Step 5: Documentation and Upload
Document each step in a README.md file.
Push all scripts, notebooks, and configuration files to the GitHub repository.
